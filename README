# Angular-Hasura-Boilerplate

### Angular 2+ (Working version: v7.0.2)


This repo has 3 boilerplates to get you started with Hasura and Angular 7.


-  __hello-world__ :

    The ```hello-world``` boilerplate consists of basic Angular application setup with GraphQLModule to get you started.

-  __basic__ :

    The ```basic``` boilerplate gives you an idea of how the ```mutations``` ```subscriptions``` and ```queries``` can be made to the Hasura GraphQL Engine.

      ** What's new? **

        - Basic signin page to log you in and create sessions.
        - Examples already set up to make queries in the ```todos``` table of Hasura's Heroku deployed app.

-  __advanced__ :

    The ```advanced``` boilerplate gives you a full fledged application built on the ```basic``` boilerplate containing Auth0 integration.

       ** What's new?**

       - Authentication using Auth0.
